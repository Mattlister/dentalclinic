# Dental Clinic

Dental Clinic

* I've designed this website as part of my job application for a junior front end developer role at Bigfoor Digital.

* The site uses HTML, CSS and Javascript within a Bootstrap shell.

### Contents

### 1. UX

* [Project Design](#Project-Design)
* [User Objects](#User-Objects)
* [Deployment](#Deployment)
* [Testing](#Testing)



## Project Design

* I liked designing the site with a bold image which instantly relates the user to a dentist. I branded the site with the image and also, icons within text content boxes. The fluid design of a single landing page allows the user to  navigate around the site via anchored links from the top to the bottom sections of the site. Colour choices were designed with a clean looking design. A clean dentist white room, colour of their uniforms and a bright layout.

* A fluid navigation bar designed with bootstrap allows responsive design on all formats of device from mobiles to tablets, laptops and larger screens. 

### Colours

* White, blue and turqoise were used as explained above, to keep in theme with all aspects of a dentist. I thought it was a good choice of colour schemes and works well with the site.


### Images

* I chose an image which instantly shows what the website is about. I know the images I was sent had elements of dentistry but I wanted a wholesome mainstream photo as the main hero image. I also didn't want to use "equipment" images as they could make some people nervouse. The child image didn't show the face of the person and so I wanted something that could add calm to a dentist's visit as some people can becaome very anxious visiting the dentis and I didn't want that. 

* The icon images I chose show detail as to what the site is about.


### Styling

* I like the applications I design to be clean without being over the top and so I did the same with this. Pricing, testimonials, all sell the dentist and hopefully would be engaging enough for a customer to contact that dentists branch and make an appointment.
 

### Fonts

* I tried and tested various fonts for the site. The fonts chosen worked throughout the site and worked well with the general design.

### UX

* Due to time restraints, I drew the layout for the site on paper rather than using a wireframes program. I knew the colour scheme I was going to use due to the logos colours. Desiging the layout on a single page helped challenge me to include interactivity and styling. The call to action function can be found within the pop up modal and I kept the styling through using pure CSS.

### Project Goals

* The primary idea for the site is to showcase a Dentists practice. One where a visitor can contact the dentis, make an appointment. Get a brief description of the dentist and hopefully find that they are a well respected practice.

### User Objects

* The website has been designed for a visitor that need to find a new dentis. It's also designed for present customers looking to make a new appointment.

### Dental clinic helps the user find a reliable dentist because:

* It's easy to use the site and find the location of the dentis.
* The user can get in touch to make an appointment
* The user can find the dentist by using the map

### This project is the best way to help them achieve these things because:

* The website has one page that has all navigation and options direct from the one page.


### This website is:

* Easy to navigate through.

* Allows the user to work through the site with an easy to understand front end design.
  Provides the user the information they need without it being overwhelming.
  Booking forms and Get in touch forms are clear and concise for when the user wants to book a holiday


### Technologies Used


* HTML
* CSS 
* Javascript
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

* Bootstrap was used to build a solid and yet simple structure which allowed the site to be responsive easily.

* Google maps were used as the maps based software for this project. 

* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

* Google was used for stylising the website fonts as it gave me a great selection to choose from. 

* [Favicons](https://www.favicon.cc/)

* Favicons was used for the URL toolbar icon

### Deployment

* This project was developed using the gitpod development software. The data is stored in github.

* The project was regularly pushed to GitHub repository https://github.com/Mattlister/dentalclinic and 
  published to GitHub pages using the GitHub settings.

### Deployment to Github

### When deploying Dental Clinic from the 

[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Mattlister/dentalclinic), I used the following process:

1. Log into GitHub.
2. From the list of GitHub repositories, select Mattlister/dentalclinic
3. At the top the page, where the menu items are, you'll see Settings.
4. Once selected, scroll down the page to the GitHub pages section
5. Under Source, click the drop-down menu labelled and select Master Branch
6. When you select Master Branch, the page will automatically be refreshed and Dental Clinic is then deployed.
7. Once done, scroll back down to the GitHub pages section and you will be able to retrieve the link to the deployed website.


1. Choose the following link: [Dental clinic repository](https://github.com/Mattlister/dentalclinic)
2. Under repository name, select "Clone or download"
3. You'll see Clone in the HTTPs section, copy the URL for the repository.
4. In your own IDE, open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to your location of choice where you'd like the directory to be made.
6. Type the command git clone, and then paste the URL copied in step 3.
7. Then Press Enter and your local clone will be created.


### I used default commands to push to Github such as:

* git status when checking what needed uploading.
* git commit -m "" with the named update between the quotes for anyone reading what changes I made. A short piece of info helps understand
* the changes I make.
* git push -u origin master which then pushes my update and I then need to enter my username and password for security.



### Testing

* I tested the website half way through the project on Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Safari. I was always using Google Chrome and found no issues when 
  using this browser. The website worked to the normal standard on Mozilla Firefox as well. So far, So good. But, On Apple's Safari browser, there were bugs 
  displayed. 

* I also used devtools in Firefox and Google Chrome. I ran my code through HTML and CSS validators and JavaScript was tested using JSHint.

### Issues found

* I have used some elements such as the <br> tag instead of padding due to some css padding changes didn't respond as I wanted. 



### Code


* HTML - All code produced by Matthew Lister except for the content such as videos and images. These were searched and found on Google Chrome and
then added into iframe and img source code which I had put together. 

### Disclaimer

* The content of the Website I have produced is for a Job application only including all images and videos.
* The links for the Facebook and Twitter sites were added for the job applications use as well


 ### How Iâ€™d like the website to be perceived:

 * This website is to be used by customers looking to find a new dentist or make an appointment with their current dentis.
